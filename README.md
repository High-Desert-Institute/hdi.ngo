# hdi.ngo
Our shortlink website

This repository is to enable people to add or edit shortlinks related to projects of the high desert institute. For example, a community garden hosts a [Cyberpony Express](https://highdesertinstitute.org/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/) node from HDI, and the node has a shortlink (hdi.ngo/xyz) in its description which links here and then redirects to the project's website. 

We are giving free websites to all the proejcts we are partnering with, but hosting details about their project on the main HDI domain and then giving them a shortlink to point people there. Everyone has full access to edit or update any important details by simply accessing the repository and editing any file. This generates a pull request which will be reviewed to make sure your changes don't break anything. Then it's live! 

The shortlink service and web hosting are offered free of charge to any groups, organizations, projects, etc partnering with HDI. Historically -- as resources allow -- we have typically also paid for domain registration for groups that want a proper domain name to point to the project's website.
